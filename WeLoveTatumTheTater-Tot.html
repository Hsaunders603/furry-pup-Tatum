        <h1 id="AboutTatum">Who is Tatum?</h1>
        <p> Tatum is a fuzzy, adorable, brown and white Labrador Retriever and Brittany Spaniel mix. 
            Tatum is a high-energy, jumpy, fun loving dog. It is really hard not to love her when you see those puppy eyes.
            She is about one year old, and is very, very cute. Look at these photos for proof! Her favorite nickname is Tatum the Tater-Tot</p>

        <h2 id="Post1"> Final Application Submitted!</h2>
        <h6>  Sunday, April 25, 2021</h6>
        
        <p>This is the first update of Tatum's adoption. 
            We submitted our FINAL application to adopt Tatum today, and some pictures of where she would live.
            We hope to get the adoption contract and approval by Wednesday!  </p> 
        
        <h2 id="Post2"> Toys Search</h2>
        <h6> Tuesday, April 27, 2021</h6>
        
        <p>We have been tirelessly searching for toys, beds, sofa covers, food, a dog crate, leashes, collars, and so much other stuff
            we didn't know we neede for a dog. One of the hardest things to find was a car seat cover to bring Tatum in the car. 
            The adoption contract has not yet been mailed to us, so we are getting worried that they might have lost it in the mail.
            Tatum leaves for New Hampshire on Thursday, so we hope the shelter gets us the papers soon. Look for an update soon!  </p> 
        <h2 id="Post3"> Dog Crate Built!</h2>
        <h6> Thursday, April 27, 2021</h6>
            
        <p> We got the adoption forms, and they have been filled out and sent! 
            We also got the dog crate and bed today, and, with quite a bit of "Wait, where does that go?" and "I think we did this wrong..."s we 
            managed to assemble a working crate and bed. Apparently, Charles can fit quite nicely inside it, so we think that it will be big enough
            for Tatum to sleep in. We have decided to just name the crate "bed", as opposed to "bett", "cama", "lit", or "télécabine". We are
            excited and anxious for Saturday, when we will meet Tatum in real life for the first time. Look out for an update Saturday or Sunday!

        <p> Tatum is fluffy. Very fluffy. She saw a chipmunk, and ran after it. I thought it was just a joke that dogs ran after squirrels and chipmunks, 
            I now know that it is very realistic and true.
